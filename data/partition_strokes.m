% Input
%  unif_stk: [n x 2] stroke, assuming uniform time sampling
%  dthresh: [scalar] if this much distance (norm) is not covered
%         at each time point, then it's a pause
%  max_sequence: [scalar] maximum length of a stop sequence, before it is
%         called it's own stroke
%
% Output
%  substrokes: [ns x 1] cell array of sub-strokes
%  unif_stk: stroke with pause sequences shortened to a single point
%  breaks: where the pauses occured
